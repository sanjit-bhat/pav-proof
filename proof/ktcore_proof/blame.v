(* [BlameSpec] formalizes the notion of blaming a set of parties who
are responsible for a bad thing happening.
[interp] maps parties to is_good flags. *)
Definition BlameSpec (err : Blame) (interp : gmap BlameTys bool) :=
  err = ∅ ∨
  err = {[ BlameUnknown ]} ∨
  (* exists bad party in blame set. *)
  (∃ p, p ∈ err ∧ interp !! p = Some false).

(* TODO: curr spec allows Blame'ing more parties than are strictly responsible.
e.g., if only server is responsible for a merkle proof not verifying,
the client dev can blame both ServerFull and AuditorFull.
to fix, need notion of "minimal party set".
e.g., this might be a def, which intuitively requires that for any Blamed party,
all remaining parties are good.

TODO: i'm not sure if this is provable.
we can't unconditionally prove that someone is good.
we can only prove that someone must be bad after observing a bad event.

TODO: minmality should take into account that ServSig is a strictly
more minimal assumption than ServFull. *)
Definition minimal (err : Blame) (interp : gmap BlameTys bool) :=
  ∀ p p', p ∈ err → p' ∈ (err ∖ {[p]}) → interp !! p' = Some true.
